## Basic SQL query

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "fdaac2c0b1"
```

`@part1`
You will learn:

- Build a basic query using `SELECT` keyword

- List of columns and expressions

- `FROM` clause

- `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`

`SELECT <column or column expression>`

`SELECT Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre FROM SALES`


`@script`
Select statement begins with the SELECT keyword followed by a column or list of columns you wish to include in the result set.

For example, you can choose a single column from a table sales using this expression

[code]

To complete this query statement, you will add FROM clause. In this chapter you will use statements that have just a single table following FROM clause.

The WHERE and ORDER BY clause are optional and can be used to filter and sort the data which will be explained in later chapters.

For this chapter, you'll be using a database containing Kaggle's Video Game Global Sales information. To the right, underneath the editor, you can see the data in this a table of the database
